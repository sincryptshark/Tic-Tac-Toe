# Tic-Tac-Toe


Playing Tic Tac Toe

There will be two players in a game. Two signs represent each player. The general signs used in the game are X and O. Finally, there will be a board with 9 boxes.

The gameplay will be as follows.

First, one user will place their sign in one of the available empty boxes.

Next, the second user will place their sign in one of the available empty boxes.

The goal of the players is to place their respective signs completely row-wise or column-wise, or diagonally.

The game goes on until a player wins the game or it ended up in a draw by filling all boxes without a winning match.
